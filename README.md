## Description

**Real-time Obstacle Detector (Computer Vision)** is a Python-based module that implements an on-device object detection pipeline for pedestrian and environmental hazards. Leveraging the ultralytics YOLOv8 framework, this repository provides reproducible scripts for training, evaluating, and exporting a custom object detector model suited for real-time applications on resource-constrained devices.

The core of the solution retrains YOLOv8-nano on a Roboflow-hosted dataset of obstacle categories (e.g., road edges, vehicles, pedestrians, dogs) with tailored augmentation strategies to improve robustness under varied lighting and occlusion conditions. A modular training script allows seamless integration of new data and augmentations, while preserving full compatibility with YOLOv8â€™s hyperparameter and callback systems.

Post-training, the pipeline includes tools to generate detailed evaluation artifacts: confusion matrices, per-class precision/recall/F1 metrics, and mAP curves. These statistics guide model refinement, ensuring that critical obstacle classes achieve high detection performance before deployment. Finally, the repository includes utilities to export the trained PyTorch model into TensorFlow Lite format (with FP16 and INT8 quantizations), preparing the detector for integration into Android or other edge platforms. Comprehensive examples demonstrate inference on single images, video streams, and whole folders of test data.
